          I've never been content with black boxes. The more deeply I understand the system in front of me, the stronger an intuition
          I build, and the better I can mold my own work to mesh with the machinery around it. That kind of shared direction
          is what drives me, when designers and devs move from merely <i>explaining</i> a common vision to actually
          feeling it.
          If we can't, do you think the user will?

        <p>
          In my free time I love traveling, experimenting with 3D art and modeling software, and making up excuses to procrastinate
          on my backlog of indie games. I'm also frequently working on weird hobby projects involving tech, crafts, or sometimes
          both – maybe I'll put some of them on this page eventually :)

        <h3>FDG 2024 Conference Web Presence</h3>
        <hr>

        <p>
          The international Foundations of Digital Games (FDG) conference series, operated annually by the
          <a class="width-kept" href="https://sasdg.org/" title="SASDG Official Site" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>Society for the Advancement of the Science of Digital Games</span></a>
          (SASDG), is a nexus for critical discussion and exploration in the academic space of game design/immersive play.
        </p>
        <p>
          I could not be prouder to have served as the Web Chair and website developer for its 19th consecutive
          conference session, FDG 2024, hosted at my own home institution of WPI for the first time.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I coordinated with both academic stakeholders and sponsor representatives from
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/studios-quality/" title="Studios Quality on LinkedIn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            Studios Quality - Xbox Game Studios
          </a>,
          I took pride in ensuring our central conference motif of inclusivity
          and community remained at the forefront. Color was crucial: the site is introduced with the warm hues
          of our campus in the spring, and the color-spectrum theme that follows evokes unity
          and builds a visual brand familiar to attendees of the conference in the last few years (e.g. 2021, 2023).
        </p>
        <p>
          Our wonderful logo by '22 alum <a href="https://shiiba.co/" title="Hannah Belan's Portfolio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>Hannah Belan</span></a>
          was my core reference; I was beyond pleased that many attendees thought the site and logo were created by the
          same person due to their consistency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Writing the HTML and stylesheet from scratch, I sought animations that felt lively
          yet avoided superfluous Javascript or problems with accessibility.
          To this end I harnessed CSS flex transitions, noticeable in the tactile "file cabinet rifling"
          metaphor of the site navigation tabs. It's always far preferable to use the constraints of CSS to guide me
          rather than fighting against it in the creative process.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also found this a delightful way to connect with our audience via an interactive reference. Harnessing
          something
          familiar in our professional world, and transforming it into both a signifier and an engaging toy at once –
          does that not
          capture the core magic of games academia?

          My first project with the <a class="width-kept" href="https://ids.wpi.edu/" title="Intentional Design Studio" target="_blank"
                                       rel="noreferrer"><span>Intentional Design Studio</span></a>
          (IDeaS) saw me collaborating closely with the <a class="width-kept"
                                                           href="https://wp.wpi.edu/projectbasedlearning/" title="Center for Project Based Learning @ WPI"
                                                           target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span>Center for Project Based Learning</span></a>
          at WPI as part of a talented team of three. We were tasked with translating the Center's guide to capacity
          building and institutional change, a rich document compiled over the course of previous research projects,
          into an
          interactive format. My personal role was as a co-designer as well as the sole developer for our React webapp.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given how uniquely the material applies depending on the reader, we felt
          that an expressive digital notebook was a perfect model: by focusing on the pace of information, and creating
          ample opportunities for learners to record their own ideas, we aimed to help our audience contextualize
          the guide into their own professional world. Thus the reader would come away from the material with a
          reflective
          handbook <i>authored by them</i>, tailored to address their team's needs, and formatted to be printed
          and shared.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my design work, I reinforced getting readers to tap into and focus the intuition
          that they already had – after all, we weren't in their heads! Who were we, to pretend to know their
          circumstances
          better than they do? Capacity building fails when treated as a "one-size-fits-all" process, so all we could
          do was give our audience <i>gentle guidance</i>; forcing their hand or condescending them would undermine our
          goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          As such, one of my feature contributions was the presentation of optional text and hint buttons
          throughout many sections, facilitated by the "little annotation guy" who ties them to an approachable face.
          Not every reader makes use of his help or external resources in their journey, but for those who do, I aimed
          to not only
          destigmatize the learning process, but to make it <i>rewarding</i> to view the endearing expressions
          and plain-english insights of a tiny mascot character.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our experimental "mind map" directory, which serves as the homepage, was built to encourage
          readers to explore and approach our content nonlinearly.
          In anticipation of future additions to this handbook, my modular content system automatically
          creates URL routes for new section objects and populates them in both this map and the chapter sidebar.

          at WPI. the app itself is a gamification proof-of-concept in teaching introductory physics concepts
          implemented in Unity. However, keeping the app's public trial online has warranted a much richer
          ecosystem of frameworks and moving parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to the hard work of many student specialists, this necessary infrastructure developed piece-by-piece
          over time. The downside was that, without executive oversight, some of these pieces meshed unevenly with one
          another, hampering the accessibility of the app.
          Students were required to individually add themselves to a class, with no security to ensure correct
          registrants.
          An exposed one-time code was used to connect each student to their class, adding inconvenient steps.
          Direct intervention by programmers was required to add new instructors, and each instructor could host only
          one class.
        </p>
        <p>
          My task was to unify all of these parts into a smooth, easy workflow for students and instructors. This saw me
          wearing <i>many</i> hats at once – all told, I wrote markup and scripts in seven languages as I bounced
          between Svelte, CSS, pure HTML/JS, backend Python + MongoDB commands, Unity UI behaviors, and Docker
          configuration content. I'm pleased to have addressed all of the listed issues, plus many other bugs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I overhauled the FBD join flow to be as one-click as possible. Building a class-management interface and API
          from the ground up, I introduced classes of two kinds: "academic" classes requiring
          direct verification of emails against a roster, and – inspired by the <i>Kahoot!</i> gamified-quiz platform –
          "trial" classes allowing any visitor to join with an invite code. Both of these are facilitated by a robust
          SMTP-based invitation mailer, as well as Unity's deep linking functionality to skip the need for
          copy-pasted login tokens and instead quietly utilize them without the user's help.
          On average this reduces the join process to simply installing an app, tapping a link, and entering your name.

          as an accessible long-form campus activity and community-building medium.
          I was our team's resident full-stack web engineer, in charge of our game's progress database and cloud hosting
          of three "story sites". I was also the React developer for our game's central hub, the <i>Comroddity</i> web
          application.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project was one of my most schedule intensive, as is the nature of a "living" public game. The central
          app went through several iterations as our design team refined their mockups; these changes helped us find the
          "core" of the game's artistic vision, a prevailing sense of coziness intentionally undercut by cryptic and
          eerie elements. Especially of note is the animated "ransom note" menu font which I scripted to this end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our team was proud to receive IMGD's own MQP award in innovation. Though our scope had to be adjusted on many
          occasions and not every idea was fully realized, we are happy to have cut much of the red tape facing academic
          ARGs, and thoroughly enjoyed engaging with our small community of dedicated players.
